                aesthetics. My aesthetic approach is rooted in enhancing your natural beauty by leveraging the body’s
                innate regenerative abilities. We prioritize treatments that rejuvenate your skin, reduce signs of
                aging, and promote a healthier, more youthful appearance—without relying on invasive procedures. Our
                approach combines advanced therapies, including regenerative solutions like platelet-rich plasma (PRP)
                and perinatal tissue, alongside the precision of microneedling using the <strong>FDA-approved Exceed™
                    Microneedling Pen by Candela</strong>. This microneedling technique creates controlled
                micro-injuries to stimulate collagen production, enhance blood flow, and support the skin’s natural
                renewal.

            <p class="micro-paragraph">
                Microneedling is a powerful aesthetic treatment designed to reduce fine lines, diminish scars, improve
                skin texture, and encourage collagen production. It also supports hair growth, offering a comprehensive
                solution to rejuvenate your appearance.
            </p>

            <h3 class="micro-subtitle">Procedure:</h3>
            <p class="micro-paragraph">
                At our clinic, we utilize the FDA-cleared Exceed™ Microneedling Pen by Candela, an advanced device that
                promotes collagen regeneration and boosts circulation for a more youthful, vibrant look. Most clients
                see noticeable improvements after just a few sessions. Following treatment, mild redness and swelling
                may occur for up to 6 days, with aftercare focusing on sun protection and avoiding strenuous activities
                for optimal results. Typically, this procedure is combined with PRP or other advanced orthobiologics.
